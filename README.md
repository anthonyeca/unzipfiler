# unziper

It is a tool that I designed to help me to decompress and "catalog" a file in ZIP format.

## You will need a file config.ini

Create a file config.ini with the following format

```
[default]
directory="directory/of/your/file"
```

In my case I used [anthony] as a variable you need to add the password and output directory, also remember to change the code in the .py file

```
[anthony]
output_directory="your/output/directory"
password ="your_passw0rd"
```
